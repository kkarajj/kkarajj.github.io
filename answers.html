    <h2>Q6:What good is sorting</h2>
    <p>
    It lets you quickly figure out the startpoints and the endpoints are. You can find errors in the data that could strongly effect the data, specifically the mean. You could find the outliers. You couldl find the minimum and maximum.

    <h2>Q7: Which field(s) gets the analysis? </h2>
    <p>
    The analysis was done for Balls, Strikes, RelSpeed, SpinRate, and SpinAxis. 
    Balls:
    Mean = 1.70
    Median = 2
    Mode = 1
    
    Strikes:
    Mean = 1.25
    Median = 1
    Mode = 0
    
    RelSpeed:
    Mean = 88.50
    Median = 89.00
    Mode = No mode
    
    SpinRate:
    Mean = 2100
    Median = 2200
    Mode = No mode
    
    SpinAxis:
    Mean = 150.75
    Median = 145
    Mode = 130
